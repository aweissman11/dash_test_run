# Tailwind CSS

You may see a CSS file, `tailwind.css` that's been generated here but it's gitignore'd. That's on purpose!

This file is autogenerated (after each build and during development) and shouldn't be modified directly.

Instead, add styles to the `/styles/app.css` file.
Or, you may add additional css files and import them into the `app.css` file.

See https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration for more details.
